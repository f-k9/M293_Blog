        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 1</h6>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper
          third of the oven. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment
          paper to prevent the eggplant from sticking to the pan. Halve the
          eggplants lengthwise and brush the cut sides lightly with olive oil.
          Place them in the prepared pan with the halved sides down.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 2</h6>
        <p>
          Roast the eggplant until the interior is very tender throughout and
          the skin is collapsing, about 35 to 40 minutes (this might take longer
          if you are using 1 large eggplant). Set the eggplant aside to cool for
          a few minutes. Flip the eggplants over and scoop out the flesh with a
          large spoon, leaving the skin behind.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 3</h6>
        <p>
          Place a mesh strainer over a mixing bowl, then transfer the flesh to
          the strainer and discard the skins. Pick out any stray bits of
          eggplant skin and discard. You want to remove as much moisture from
          the eggplant here as possible, so let the eggplant rest for a few
          minutes and shake/stir the eggplant to release some more moisture.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 4</h6>
        <p>
          Discard all of the eggplant drippings, drain and wipe out the bowl,
          and dump the eggplant into the bowl. Add the garlic and lemon juice to
          the eggplant and stir vigorously with a fork until eggplant breaks
          down. Add the tahini to the bowl and stir until it's incorporated.
          While stirring, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Continue stirring
          until the mixture is pale and creamy, and use your fork to break up
          any particularly long strings of eggplant.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 5</h6>
        <p>
          Stir in the parsley, salt and cumin. Season to taste with more salt
          and more lemon juice, if you'd like a more tart flavor.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 6</h6>
        <p>
          Transfer the baba ganoush to a serving bowl and lightly drizzle olive
          oil on top. Lastly, sprinkle parsley and smoked paprika on top. Serve
          with accompaniments of your choice. It's also great on sandwiches!
