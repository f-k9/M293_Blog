        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 1</h6>
        <p>
          Cut chicken into strips, and clean of any fatty bits. Place in a large
          bowl. (You can also get your butcher to cut it for you) Pour olive oil
          over the chicken, then add all the minced garlic and all the spices.
          Toss very well to combine, might be easier to do this with a gloved
          hand. Add the yogurt and toss to combine thoroughly.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 2</h6>
        <p>
          Place chicken in fridge for 3 hours or overnight to marinate. If you
          have to cut down on marination time, that's fine, just marinate for
          however long you can.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 3</h6>
        <p>
          Once the chicken has finished marinating, heat the oven to 220 C
          (425F). Place chicken strips on baking sheet (we lined ours with
          parchment paper)and make sure you spread them out so they are all in a
          single layer.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 4</h6>
        <p>
          Bake for 20 minutes, until cooked through. Halfway through, use a
          metal spatula or tongs to move the strips around and separate any that
          have clumped together.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 5</h6>
        <p>
          Optional, but recommended. After the chicken has cooked through,
          drizzle with some olive oil and put back into the oven, this time on
          broil function. Broil for 2-3 minutes or until the top is browned in
          places. I took my photographs before broiling, in case you were
          wondering about the color of my chicken.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 6 (Make the Garlic Sauce)</h6>
        <p>
          Mix together the yogurt and labneh, or just greek yogurt, crushed
          garlic, lemon juice, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. You can
          whisk, or use a little blender. Refrigerate until ready to use.
