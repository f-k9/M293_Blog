        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 1 (Make the Broth)</h6>
        <p>
          Place all the ingredients for the broth in a large pot, then add
          enough room temperature water to just cover everything. Bring to a
          boil over medium heat, then reduce to a simmer. Skim off the foam that
          accumulates on top and discard. You may have to do this several times
          during the cooking process. Simmer for 3-4 hours. Chicken will be
          cooked through, and you'll have a flavorful stock.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 2</h6>
        <p>
          Once stock is ready and chicken is cooked, Strain the chicken stock to
          separate chicken from the broth. Pick out the chicken pieces from the
          cooked vegetables and discard the veggies. Set chicken aside until
          chicken has cooled enough to handle, then use your hands to debone and
          shred the chicken into pieces. Set aside shredded chicken for now.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 3 (Make the Muluchiya)</h6>
        <p>
          Place the chicken stock back into a large saucepan. On medium heat,
          add the diced onion, the bags of mulukihya (you don't need to thaw
          them), the ground coriander, mixed or seven spices, and a big pinch of
          salt and pepper.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 4</h6>
        <p>
          Place the chicken stock back into a large saucepan. On medium heat,
          add the diced onion, the bags of mulukihya (you don't need to thaw
          them), the ground coriander, mixed or seven spices, and a big pinch of
          salt and pepper.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 5</h6>
        <p>
          While mulukihya is simmering, place olive oil in a skillet, and heat
          on medium. Add the chopped coriander and crushed garlic, and saut√© for
          a couple minutes until garlic just turns light golden brown. Add this
          mixture to the mulukhiya stew, and stir through. Taste for seasoning
          and adjust. If you like the mulukhiya thinner, you can add a little
          more broth. Serve with rice, and lemon juice on the side.
