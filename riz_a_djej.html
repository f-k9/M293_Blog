        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 1</h6>
        <p>
          Begin by preparing your chicken. Remove the neck and giblets and pat
          the chicken dry with paper towels. In a large stockpot, place the
          whole chicken and pour enough water to cover it completely. Season
          with salt and pepper.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 2</h6>
        <p>
          When the chicken comes to a boil, skim any fat that rises to the top.
          Peel and cut the small onion in half and place in the pot along with
          the bay leaves and cloves. Cover halfway and let simmer on medium-high
          heat until the chicken is cooked through, about 1 hour.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 3</h6>
        <p>
          Remove the cooked chicken and set aside to cool. Once it has cooled
          enough to handle, shred the breasts into course chunks. Place the
          cooked chicken legs and wings on a baking pan and broil until golden
          brown and crispy on top. (This step is optional, you can shred these
          parts of the chicken with the breast if you prefer.)
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 4</h6>
        <p>
          Add the vegetable oil to a pan and heat for 1-2 minutes on
          medium-high. Add the almonds and cook for 2-3 minutes, constantly
          mixing until golden brown. Repeat with remaining nuts and set aside.
          Rinse the rice 3 times or until the water runs clear. Drain the water
          and set aside.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 5</h6>
        <p>
          In a medium pot, add the ground beef and cook on medium heat until
          fully browned. Add the butter, salt, pepper, 7 spices and ground
          cinnamon and sauté for a few minutes.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 6</h6>
        <p>
          Add the washed rice in with the ground beef mixture and mix well.
          Measure 2 ¼ cups of the fresh chicken stock you made earlier, and pour
          into the pot of rice. Cook on medium-high heat until the rice comes to
          a boil then, lower the heat to medium-low and cover with a lid. Cook
          for 15 minutes until all the stock is absorbed. Empty the rice into a
          large serving platter. Sprinkle the nuts on top and shredded chicken.
          Serve with a side salad like fattoush or plain yogurt.
