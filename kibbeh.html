        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 1</h6>
        <p>
          Cover a fine mesh strainer with a light cloth (a cheesecloth, if you
          have one). Add the bulgur wheat in, then place the strainer into a
          bowl filled with water. Let the fine bulgur wheat soak in the water
          for 15 minutes, then pull the cloth, holding the bulgur, and squeeze
          all the water out. You may do this a couple of times until you are
          sure the bulgur is rid of water. Set aside for now.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 2</h6>
        <p>
          Now make the kibbeh (the actual dough that you will later use to form
          the kibbeh shells). Put the onion, ground beef, spices and pinch of
          salt into the bowl of a large food processor. Process until the meat
          is very finely ground almost into a paste. Transfer the meat mixture
          into a large bowl and add the bulgur wheat. Use damp hands to combine
          the bulgur with the meat mixture to make a dough. Cover and
          refrigerate until later.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 3</h6>
        <p>
          Now make the filling. Heat about 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet
          or frying pan. Saute the onion until just golden, then add the ground
          beef. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the meat is
          fully browned. Add the toasted pine nuts, the spices, and the salt and
          pepper. Stir to combine. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 4</h6>
        <p>
          Remove the kibbeh dough from the fridge. To stuff the kibbeh, you need
          to have damp hands. Place a small bowl of water next to you. Prepare a
          baking sheet and line it with parchment paper.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 5</h6>
        <p>
          With both the bowl of kibbeh dough and the filling near, you can begin
          stuffing the kibbeh. Dampen your hands with some water, take a handful
          of the kibbeh dough (about 2 tablespoon or so) and form into somewhat
          of an oval-shaped disc in the palm of one hand. Use your finger to
          make a well in the middle of the disc, and gradually hallow the disc
          out to make a larger well or hole for the filling. Using a spoon, add
          about 1 tablespoon of the filling. Seal the dough on top and, using
          both hands, carefully shape it into an oval (football-type shape).
          Place the stuffed kibbeh on the baking sheet lined with parchment
          paper. Repeat the stuffing steps until you run out, be sure to have
          damp hands throughout.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 6</h6>
        <p>
          Chill the stuffed kibbeh for 1 hour. Heat the oil in a deep frying pan
          to 350 degrees F (you'll want the oil hot enough that you can see some
          gentle bubbling, but not too hot where it will burn the kibbeh
          shells). Deep-fry the kibbeh in the hot oil, in batches being
          carefully not to crowd them, until the kibbeh shells are brown (about
          5 minutes or so). With a slotted spoon or tongs, carefully remove the
          kibbeh and place them on a pan lined with paper towel to drain. Repeat
          until you have fried all the stuffed kibbeh.
