        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 1</h6>
        <p>
          Begin by rinsing the rice 3 times with cold water. In a medium-sized
          bowl, combine the ground beef, washed rice, 7 spices, cinnamon, black
          pepper and 1 teaspoon of salt. Mix to combine. Unpack the jar of grape
          leaves and place in a colander. Rinse the brine using cold water and
          set aside to drain any water.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 2</h6>
        <p>
          Place a grape leaf vein-side up on a large plate or cutting board.
          Using a small paring knife, cut the small stem off. Drop about 1
          tablespoon of the beef and rice filling and spread into a thin line
          leaving enough room on both sides of the leaf for rolling.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 3 (Make the Muluchiya)</h6>
        <p>
          Fold each side of the leaf over the filling beginning with the bottom
          side and roll tightly to prevent the leaf from opening up while
          cooking. Repeat until you have no more leaves left. *If the grape leaf
          is very large, cut in half, then stuff and roll.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 4</h6>
        <p>
          Using a paper towel, pat the lamb chops dry. Season with a half
          teaspoon of salt. In a deep pot, heat one tablespoon of vegetable oil.
          Sear the lamb chops on high heat for 2-3 minutes on each side.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 5</h6>
        <p>
          Arrange the stuffed leaves side by side and on top of each other over
          the seared lamb chops. Place a plate about 1-2 inches smaller in
          diameter than the pot, over the stuffed leaves. Fill the pot with
          enough water to cover all the leaves and up to the plate. Add the
          freshly squeezed lemon juice and season with remaining half teaspoon
          of salt. Cook on medium to high heat until boiling. Reduce to
          medium-low heat and cook for 45min to 1 hour. To check if grape leaves
          are done, take a grape leaf out and try it!
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h6>Step 5</h6>
        <p>
          Once the grape leaves are done cooking, Flip the pot over onto a
          serving platter. There should very little lemon water left. Serve
          warm.
